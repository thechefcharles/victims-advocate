          <p className="text-sm text-slate-200">
            The Illinois Crime Victims Compensation Program is designed to help
            people who were physically injured by a violent crime, or family
            members of someone who was killed by a violent crime.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-xs text-slate-300 space-y-1.5">
            <li>
              The injured victim themselves (if over 18) can apply for their
              own expenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              A parent or legal guardian can apply on behalf of a minor or an
              adult who cannot apply on their own.
            </li>
            <li>
              A family member or other person who paid, or became responsible
              to pay, funeral or medical bills can also apply for those
              expenses.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[11px] text-slate-400">
            You do not need a lawyer to apply, and you do not have to work with
            an advocate to use this program. NxtStps is designed to help you
            complete the application and get organized.

          <p className="text-sm text-slate-200">
            CVC does not pay for everything, but it can help with many crime-
            related expenses that are not fully covered by insurance or other
            programs.

            means they will look first at insurance, public aid, and other

            You can start your application without all of your documents, but
            the Attorney General&apos;s office will eventually need proof to

          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-slate-200">
            Applying for help can feel overwhelming, especially after a violent
            event. It&apos;s completely normal to feel numb, angry, scared, or
            exhausted while trying to handle paperwork.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-xs text-slate-300 space-y-1.5">
            <li>You can pause the intake at any time and come back later.</li>
            <li>
              It&apos;s okay if you don&apos;t remember every detail exactly;
              write what you can.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can ask a trusted friend, family member, or advocate to sit
              with you while you fill this out.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you feel overwhelmed, it may help to focus on one small piece
              at a time (for example, just medical bills today).

          </ul>

            crisis hotline. NxtStps cannot respond to emergencies.
